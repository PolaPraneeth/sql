This can be done in two ways.


select max(sal) from emp
where sal<(select max(sal) from emp);

Explanation:
The query retrieves the second-highest salary from the emp table. 
It first identifies the highest salary with a subquery, then the main query finds the maximum salary that is less than this highest salary, 
effectively returning the second-highest salary.


The other way:

select max(sal) from emp
where sal not in (select max(sal) from emp);

The query fetches the highest salary from the emp table, excluding the overall highest salary, 
effectively aiming to find the second highest salary by excluding the topmost salary using a subquery.
